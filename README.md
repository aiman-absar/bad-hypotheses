On the futility of the pursuit of happiness

Like many those before us, and many more to come; we will always strive to be happy. The fundamental paradox at the heart of this pursuit, is that happiness doesn’t appear to those who seek it.

This whole topic may seem trite, and beaten to death with several spiked baseball bats. Because it has been. But, like some twisted whack-a-mole game, “it” comes up, taunting us.  Despite the constant discussion over millennia, we as humans never seem to get it. We have a constantly shifting goal post of what it means to be happy. Like those dogs who chase after cars, we don’t actually know what to do when we actually catch up to the car.

It feels nice to have a goal like that. We fool ourselves into thinking that having such a target is enough to fulfill ourselves in the long run. Because it deludes us into thinking that having that goal means we are unconsciously working towards it. But we aren’t, and that’s the point. 

Some think it’s love. Some think it’s a fulfilling livelihood. Some think it’s a lot more nebulous than that. I am of the last group. This is the part of the discussion where any semblance of a structure will start breaking down. I am not sorry about that.

I. The need for completeness in our lives

I’m gonna be real here for a second. This need to talk about, well, “this”, didn’t come out of no-where. It’s about a breakup. While it’s cliche, I’d like to think that it doesn’t matter how we get to this point. What matters is that, at various points in life, we will be forced to confront this fundamental truth. We can fight it tooth and nail, like Frank fought his friend Nada in the movie They Live. Frank knew what he’d see if he put on the sunglasses, and yet he fought Nada’s attempt at making Frank see the truth about the world. Because deep down, he knew the beautiful lie he tells himself puts no impetus on him to break out of this shell we cocoon in. The comforts in life soothe us. The dark womb of Capitalism- and I say dark to mean impenetrable, and not sinister- makes it easy to ignore the mirror that reflects back to us what we look like. We are all Dorain Gray’s in our own ways, and we all have a choice to glimpse that gritty painting from time to time. But why do that?

Growing up we tell ourselves what we will need to feel complete. It depends on our precise upbringing and childhood, paternal love and/or detachment, and what we grow up seeing around us. For me it was the pursuit of some great love. I have this intense urge to build something. A collaborative energy seeps through my veins. I tell myself, if I find a partner to lean on, and who can also lean on me, I can feel complete and therefore subject myself to building a great future. This nagging need also makes for some terrible life choices. We are all broken pieces, looking for the missing pieces of our lives. Like people are somehow jigsaw puzzles. But that’s wholly reductive, and it reduces us to pieces. It limits our potential as individuals who can thrive on their own distinct energies.

Instead of thinking of ourselves as static pieces, we should instead look at ourselves as seedlings. Seedlings require sunlight, water and nutrients to grow, but not other seedlings. We have the power within us to find the sunlight, the water and the nutrients to feed our growth. And if we nurture ourselves well enough, we will find ourselves as immense, shade-giving trees that are wholly sufficient, and in a way, complete.
